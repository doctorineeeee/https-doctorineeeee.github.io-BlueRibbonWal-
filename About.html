        <h5>Rachel, Founder of Blue Ribbon SG</h5>
          <p>In November 2008, 9-year-old Sarah was identified as a victim of severe child abuse. Initially unnoticed, the abuse came to light when a concerned teacher noticed behavioral changes in March 2008. Sarah bravely shared her story in October, leading to her official identification as a child abuse victim. Grateful for her foster family, social workers, and therapist, Sarah has rebuilt her life through therapeutic activities like art, music, and equine-assisted therapy. Today, she advocates for other survivors as a peer mentor and support group facilitator, supporting their journey to healing and empowerment.</p>

            <p>In September 2018, Ethan, a 6-year-old boy, was discovered as a victim of prolonged child abuse.

Encouraging him to open up, Ethan found the courage to disclose his painful experiences in October, leading to his official recognition as a child abuse victim.

              Reflecting on his tumultuous journey, Ethan expresses profound gratitude for his caring foster parents, dedicated child protection workers, and his compassionate therapist, who have been instrumental in his recovery and transformation.</p>
